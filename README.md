# Weather App
Well,yeah. Thats it actually.
Its an simple Web App written in React with Javascript.

Im planning to rewrite this App in React Native to make it available as a full-native 
android app.

You can use this app by visiting [http://weather.renaxdev.de](http://weather.renaxdev.de/) in your browser
